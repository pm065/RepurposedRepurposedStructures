Packs that I will make eventually, in order of priority:
- [x] Buzzierer Bees - Adds apiary houses for each village
- [x] Buzzierer Bees + Environmental - Changes swamp apiary houses to willow
- [ ] Environmentally Friendly - Changes Flower Forest temple to Wisteria, adds carpenter and ceramist houses to villages and changes swamp mineshaft to willow. Does not contain the village wood swap; the original Environmental pack is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as the new one presumes you have it. When this is made, the BB-Environmental pack will be merged into it.
- [ ] Quark Taiga Villages - Changes giant taiga villages to cobblestone bricks. As always, will contain compatibilty stuff.

If it turns out new structures with only datapacks are entirely possible, then I want to do this too. If not, I'll make at least an attempt to follow TG's structure mod tutorial:
- [ ] Autumnal Villages - Adds Autumn Villages in Autumnity's biomes, made of maple wood
- [ ] Endergetically Expanded Villages - Adds Puff Villages, containing strange Poise houses full of Puff Bugs
- [ ] Villages in the Outer End - Adds Alien Villages, containing Azure enclosures with Spectraflies, and Violite Villages, containing Violite 

I also want to make some general purpose packs too, i.e. not requiring RS:
- [ ] Generally Good Villages - Improves villages considerably
- [ ] Quirky Quarky Structures - Switches a few blocks in villages for Quark variants
- [ ] Quirky Quarky Compat (BB/Env/Atmo/Aut/Enderg/Outer/etc) - Compat for QQS
- [ ] Atmospheric Villages - Switches out sandstone Desert Villages for yucca ones
- [ ] Generally Atmospheric Villages - Compatability between Generally Good Villages and Atmospheric. Use instead of the regular Atmospheric pack if you're using GGV.

General ones that would require the ability to make new structures:
- [ ] Extra Ender Structures - Adds the rare purpur Ender Fortress and a tiny Ender Frontier Village

Packs I am considering but am unsure about:
- [ ] Project: Vibrant Villages - PVJ wood types in RS villages plus some new ones, e.g. fir in mountain ones

Of course, all of this is very ambitious, so some may never come to fruitition. Just throwing ideas around here.
