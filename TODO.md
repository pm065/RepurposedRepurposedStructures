In order of priority:
- [ ] Buzzier Bees pack - Adds apiary houses for each village
- [ ] Buzzier Bees + Environmental compat pack - Changes swamp apiary houses to willow
- [ ] Improved Environmental pack - Changes Flower Forest temple to Wisteria, adds carpenter and ceramist houses to villages and changes swamp mineshaft to willow. Does not contain the village wood swap; the original Environmental pack is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as the new one presumes you have it.
- [ ] Endergetic pack - Expands End villages to contain alien-looking Poise houses full of Puff Bugs
- [ ] Outer End pack - Expands End villages to contain Azure and Violite 'zoos' with Spectraflies and Stalkers respectively
- [ ] Atmospheric pack - Revamps Badlands Villages/Dungeons/etc to Yucca
- [ ] Atmospheric + Buzzier Bees compat pack - Changes badlands apiary houses to yucca
- [ ] Atmospheric + Environmental compat pack - Changes badlands ceramist/carpenter houses to yucca
- [ ] Quark pack - Changes giant taiga villages to cobblestone bricks
- [ ] Quark + Buzzier Bees compat pack - Changes giant taiga apiarist houses to cobblestone bricks
- [ ] Quark + Environmental compat pack - Changes giant taiga ceramist/carpenter houses to cobblestone bricks

I wanted to create some kind of Autumnity pack which adds an entirely new village (in the maple forests) but I'm not sure if that can be done with simply datapacks.
