I've read bad things about the Unlicense, such as it apparently being illegal in Germany, but don't know any good alternatives. I used to use CC0, but the a few DuckDuckGo searches cryptically tell me that it 'wasn't exactly made for software'.

Honestly, I probably won't get sued for any of my things (I'm very careful about taking other's work when the license is unclear), and I feel the Unlicense is less of a license for my work, more a strong statement. And, of course, an informal confirmation that stealing is okay :)

Sorry if my choice makes things difficult at any point, and if you know any better public domain licenses please be sure to let me know.

Thanks!
