I've read bad things about the Unlicense, such as it apparently being illegal in Germany, but don't know any good alternatives. I used to use CC0, but the interblag cryptically told me in multiple places that it wasn't made for software.

Sorry if my choice makes things difficult at any point, and if you know any better public domain licenses please be sure to let me know.

Thanks!
